<p>I&#8217;m not an avid gamer, having pretty much given up gaming after Doom II, but occasionally someone will recommend a game to me that I try out and can&#8217;t help playing till I finish. Superbrothers: Sword &amp; Sworcery EP (s:s&amp;s ep) has been one of those games.</p>
<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lnfnb0kLcM1qao3et.png"/></p>
<p>The game is a mix of atmospheric 8-bit-esque graphics, moody music and witty, sarcastic humour that is a staple of the old skool swashbuckling adventure games. Like most adventure games the storyline is pretty much linear with only a few chances to do stuff out of order, but there is enough in there to make you feel like you are making your own decisions even if you are being led by the nose.  The use of special iPad and iPhone features like the accelerometer and multi-touch gestures make you feel like you&#8217;re playing a game that has really been thought through well.</p>
<p>Overall, it is a pretty basic game that only takes a few hours to get through from beginning to end, but given that it is currently less than AU$6 on the app store it is much better value dollar per hour wise than nearly any movie I&#8217;ve seen in the past year.   Given that it is an adventure game it probably won&#8217;t have a lot of re-play value as most of the magic is in watching the story unfolding. </p>
<p>I&#8217;d highly recommend s:s&amp;s ep to any gamer that is in to a bit of atmospheric mood music, fun story lines and is feeling a bit nostalgic for the likes of Monkey Island and Space Quest.</p>
<p>You can buy it from <a title="Superbrothers: Sword &amp; Sworcery EP" href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/superbrothers-sword-sworcery/id424912055">the app store</a>.</p>
