<p>I&#8217;ve been reading the Foundation series by Isaac Asimov. I thought I had read them before, I&#8217;ve read quite a lot of his robot series after all, but I haven&#8217;t read the Foundation series as it turns out. So here I am now, finally reading them. It&#8217;s funny reading them now. The books really show their age in some ways. In the early novels everyone is smoking, and even in the later books women are more often portrayed as secondary characters with men leading the way.</p>
<p><span>But, I don&#8217;t really want to talk about the Foundation series. Really, it is the mindset that it has got me in to while I have been reading the books. Back in the late 90&#8217;s or maybe it was early 00&#8217;s I used to listen to a skit by a stand up comedian, maybe it was Denis Leary or Anthony Morgan, either way, at some point in the skit the comedian gets on to the subject or jetpacks, and how we were promised them and they still don&#8217;t exist. It is an expression of disappointment, angry disappointment, punctuated with a lot of swearing.  That is how I feel some days. It isn&#8217;t just about the jetpacks either. It was about life in general. Where the fuck our jetpacks. Why are we still mired in religious intolerance, climate change denial and general selfish butt fuckery. Surely we should have all realised by now that it is our duty to leave the planet in a better state than we found it. That we all should just get the fuck along, and get on with the most amazing adventure available to human kind, the exploration of space. </span></p>
<p><span>Sigh. It is just plain disappointing. Sure, mid-century science fiction was naively optimistic about the future of human kind, but I&#8217;ll take that optimism any day over what seems to be our future now. And that just makes it worse. I should be reading optimistic science fiction like Asimov&#8217;s and feeling motivated to get out there and make a difference, but instead I just look around and see education budgets being cut, environmental projects being cut, and governments and corporations acting like they can&#8217;t see a future beyond the next quarterly statement. </span></p>
<p><span>But perhaps there is something else there.  So social attitudes have moved on somewhat from when Asimov first wrote Foundation. Progress seems to move forward at a snails pace, but at least there has been progress. That realisation, the pace of change is what is the most disappointing in the end. We haven&#8217;t got jetpacks now, and based on the observed rate of change, I doubt we&#8217;ll have them in my lifetime. I really hope I&#8217;m wrong, but now, I guess it will be a pleasant surprise instead of disappointment.</span></p>
<p>End ramble.</p>
