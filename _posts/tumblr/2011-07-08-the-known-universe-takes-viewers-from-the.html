Every star, planet, and quasar seen in the film is possible because of  the world&#8217;s most complete four-dimensional map of the universe, the  Digital Universe Atlas that is maintained and updated by astrophysicists  at the American Museum of Natural History. The new film, created by the  Museum,  is part of an exhibition, Visions of the Cosmos: From the  Milky Ocean to an Evolving Universe, at the Rubin Museum of Art in  Manhattan through May 2010. <br/><br/>Data: Digital Universe, American Museum of Natural History<br/><a title="http://www.haydenplanetarium.org/universe/" target="_blank" href="http://www.haydenplanetarium.org/universe/">http://www.haydenplanetarium.org/universe/</a></p>
