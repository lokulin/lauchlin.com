<blockquote>
<p>John Nese is the proprietor of Galcos Soda Pop Stop in LA. His father  ran it as a grocery store, and when the time came for John to take  charge, he decided to convert it into the ultimate soda-lovers  destination. About 500 pops line the shelves, sourced lovingly by John  from around the world. John has made it his mission to keep small  soda-makers afloat and help them find their consumers. Galcos also acts  as a distributor for restaurants and bars along the West Coast,  spreading the gospel of soda made with cane sugar (no high-fructose corn  syrup if John can avoid it).</p>
