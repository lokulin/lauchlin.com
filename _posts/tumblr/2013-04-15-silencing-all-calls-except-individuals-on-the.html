<p>So, I really hate hearing the phone ring.  I&#8217;d rather people e-mail or SMS me, but there are certain people I really need to be able to answer straight away.  Unfortunately the iPhone (3Gs) doesn&#8217;t seem to have an easy way of silencing or blocking certain numbers.  So as a work around I thought I&#8217;d install a silent ringtone, assign it as my default ring tone and just add personalised ringtones to the people I need to answer quickly.</p>
<p>To get this to work I needed two things.</p>
<ol><li>A silent ringtone that would work on the iPhone.</li>
<li>A way of getting the ringtone on to my iPhone from my Linux desktop.</li>
</ol><p>Number 1 was a simple <a href="https://www.google.com.au/search?q=silent+ringtone+m4r">Google search</a> away.  Richard K Miller has a <a href="http://richardkmiller.com/702/iphone-tip-use-a-silent-ringtone-to-screen-calls-in-your-sleep">silent ringtone to download for free</a>.</p>
<p>Number 2 was also pretty straight forward thanks to the info found on <a href="http://everydaylht.com/howtos/desktop/create-ringtones-for-your-iphone-using-linux/">everydayLHT</a>. I just needed to follow the steps under the &#8220;Putting The Ringtone On Your Phone&#8221; heading.  The only other things to note are:</p>
<ol><li>Make sure you name the files with a four letter name, e.g. YRTG.m4r.</li>
<li>You may need to restart your phone after you have uploaded the ringtone and saved the &#8220;Ringtones.plist&#8221; file.</li>
<li>My phone was missing &#8220;Ringtones.plist&#8221; and the Ringtones folder so I just made them and it worked ok.</li>
</ol><p>I&#8217;m not sure about the file name length, my phone had problems but it might just be that I hadn&#8217;t restarted the phone.  It is getting old and a bit temperamental.</p>
<p>You can combine this with the new Do Not Disturb feature on the phone to screen and silence all calls but the few that you want to come through.</p>
