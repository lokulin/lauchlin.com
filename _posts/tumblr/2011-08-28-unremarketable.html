<p>Random thoughts on a sunny day.</p>
<p>I read somewhere once that children are born materialists, born consumers.  You can see it really, lust for the latest toy, the latest fad, wanting what other kids of got.  Modern consumerism tempts otherwise grown adults to regress to that child state, selling big boys toys, lifestyles, dreams.  And now with more disposable cash than ever, people consume that dream, or they turn themselves inside out trying.  For me tho, being an adult in the 21st century is more than that.  It is realizing that you don&#8217;t have to let go of the child inside you, the one that has dreams, ambitions, goals, but that at the same time you have to laugh at the child inside you, the one that throws a tantrum when it doesn&#8217;t get the toy it wants.  There is more to life than toys, than other peoples dreams.  Living in the 21st century to me is being a child and an adult all at the same time, taking the responsibility for the world around us, but always looking at it with wondering eyes.  But perhaps it has always been like that and I just never noticed till now.</p>
