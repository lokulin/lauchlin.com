<p>So, I wanted to follow my local candidate but unfortunately they are technologically literate enough to use twitter and facebook but not the old school RSS or e-mail lists. Sign of the times right. Anyway.</p>
<p>Facebook pages can be viewed as an atom feed.  You just need to get the page id. So for Chris&#8217; page it is:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.facebook.com/feeds/page.php?format=atom10&amp;id=155817241253041">http://www.facebook.com/feeds/page.php?format=atom10&amp;id=155817241253041</a></p>
<p>Twitter turned off their RSS feeds a while back so you have to use a service like rssitfor me.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.rssitfor.me/getrss?name=GreensJagaJaga">http://www.rssitfor.me/getrss?name=GreensJagaJaga</a></p>
<p>Did I ever tell you I fucking hate Twitface and their stupid walled gardens?  Don&#8217;t even get me started on the abomination that is Skype.  What ever happened to open standards.</p>
