<p>I&#8217;m afraid of writing (on the Internet) mostly because I&#8217;m afraid of saying something stupid or something I&#8217;ll regret later in life.  I know I wasn&#8217;t always this afraid, and I&#8217;ve got the stupid things I&#8217;ve said on the Internet to prove it.  I used to be quite gung-ho about writing and asking stupid questions but now I just look back and cringe, and it blocks me all up.  This fear of writing has now extended past just being a fear of writing on the Internet, but a fear of writing anywhere there is going to be an audience.  Apparently I&#8217;m not alone in this however.  A work colleague continually says I undersell my work, and my writing ability, and that I should try harder to &#8220;sell&#8221; it.  Sometimes I just feel like they are saying that to make me feel better tho.</p>
<p>So, how am I working to combat these fears?  Well, first off I address the notion that my work and writing ability is no good by saying to myself.  &#8221;Lauchlin, my work colleague is far more experience than I am, has much more experience writing and publishing that I have, and if they say I am ok at writing, and that my ideas are good, then I am insulting them by questioning their opinion.&#8221;  It doesn&#8217;t always help, and it doesn&#8217;t take away all the fear.  But it nails that particular monster on the head.</p>
<p>The next thing I say to myself is, &#8220;Lauchlin, past you is not now you&#8221;.  Sure, I&#8217;ve made mistakes, said and written stupid stuff, but hopefully I&#8217;ve learnt from some of it.  I&#8217;ll make some of the same mistakes again, and I&#8217;ll make new mistakes in the future.</p>
<p>Between these two strategies, I&#8217;m starting to feel less blocked up about writing.  My next strategy to try is to just try and write more.  At least 100 words a day.  It might not be online, it might just be an e-mail, a note on some paper, or a few lines in the paper I&#8217;m trying to write with my colleague, but it has to be 100 words.  Future Lauchlin, wish me luck with it.</p>
