<p>Occasionally I&#8217;ve had the need to run a regular short cron job but have been without access to a server and have not wanted to leave my home PC running.Â  <a title="http://www.onlinecronjobs.com/" href="http://www.onlinecronjobs.com/">Onlinecronjobs.com</a> is a handy service that you can use to request a given web page or script at a set interval.</p>
