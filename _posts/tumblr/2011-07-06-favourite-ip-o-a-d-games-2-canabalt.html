<p><a title="Canabalt" href="http://www.canabalt.com/">Canabalt</a> is a simple yet fun game that you can play pretty much anywhere.  It is essentially a side scroller with a very simple aim, to run as far as you can jumping gaps between buildings and avoiding falling objects including the occasional giant robot. The tunes it comes with are atmospheric and are occasionally updated with new indie tunes.  For extra cool factor you can play it online at <a title="http://www.canabalt.com/" href="http://www.canabalt.com/">http://www.canabalt.com/</a>.  I don&#8217;t play it very often but it is simple enough that I can just fire it up and play for a minute or two if I am waiting for a train or tram and have nothing better to do.</p>
