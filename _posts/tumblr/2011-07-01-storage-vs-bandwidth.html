<p>An Interesting info-graphic relating storage vs. bandwidth. It seems to be sponsored by BackBlaze an online secure storage company so I&#8217;m not sure what they have to gain by showing that it is cheaper to buy more off-line storage in the form of hard-drives.</p>
<p>That said, with the roll out of the NBN in Australia perhaps we&#8217;ll start seeing the bandwidth vs. storage cost curve start to head in the opposite direction.</p>
