title: I’ve been listening to Ufomammut (from Italy) a while now and I have to say
  that Idolum is quickly becoming one of my favourite albums. The droning repetitive
  sounds and abstract vocals have a haunting quality to them that seem to echo from
  the distant, primal past while still reverberating in to a slightly disturbing and
  sometimes dark future.  Despite these dark overtones there is still an occasional
  sense of brightness and optimism in some of the tracks with the vocals and harmonics
  infrequently lifting in vibrancy.  The tracks are both enjoyable as a concious listening
  exercise, following the slowly undulating progressions or just as a great accompaniment
  to a pensive train ride or walk.
