<p>I have started using the Chrome start page as my launch page to get to all my usual online &#8220;Apps&#8221; but there are a few sites that I like to visit regularly that don&#8217;t have apps to launch the site.  I really don&#8217;t like the layout of the most visited page in chrome so instead I made a few basic apps that are essentially just links to the page I want to visit.  This way I get a pretty icon and it all just lives in my Apps page rather than having to flick between the apps and most visited page.</p>
<p>Feel free to use them yourself if you want.</p>
