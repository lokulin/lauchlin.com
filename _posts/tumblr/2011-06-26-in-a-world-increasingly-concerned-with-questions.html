<p>In a world increasingly concerned with questions of energy production  and raw material shortages, this project explores the potential of  desert manufacturing, where energy and material occur in abundance.<br/> In this experiment sunlight and sand are used as raw energy and material  to produce glass objects using a 3D printing process, that combines  natural energy and material with high-tech production technology.<br/><br/> Solar-sintering aims to raise questions about the future of  manufacturing and trigger dreams of the full utilisation of the  production potential of the worldâ€™s most efficient energy resource -  the sun. Whilst not providing definitive answers this experiment aims to  provide a point of departure for fresh thinking.</p>
